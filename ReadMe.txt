.ino file created to send out simple SOS Morse Code via external LED of Arduino.

== Description == 

The program was written on Ubuntu VM of a Macbook Pro.

The  5 V positive and 0 V GND pins, an External LED with the longer lead connected to the 13 pin and the shorter lead connected to the Green-Blue-Brown resistor (560 Ω).

The Arduino was set up as seen in “3.6 Part 4 - The Pushbutton”, although the push button as well as the potentiometer was not used in Exercise 0.

The code of the .ino file was taken from section “3.9 Part 7 - Using Procedures to Reuse Code” and modified so that the code for sendDot and sendMediumGap was completed.
